PCA Assignment  Anderson Cancer Center

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets. The main goal is to identify essential variables for securing donor funding at the Anderson Cancer Center. Additionally, a logistic regression model is implemented as an optional task to predict cancer presence based on the reduced dataset.
